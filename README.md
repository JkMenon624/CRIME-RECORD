The Digital Crime Record Management System is an SQL-based application developed to
replace inefficient paper-based methods with a centralized, secure database for managing
criminal records. It stores and organizes vital details such as FIRs, case information, victims,
suspects, witnesses, evidence, and case progress, ensuring quick access and reliable data
organization.
The system enforces ACID-compliant transactions for consistent and accurate operations, uses
role-based access control to safeguard sensitive information, and incorporates key DBMS
concepts including entity–relationship modeling, indexing, query optimization, and backup
strategies. With its scalable and efficient design, it enhances the speed, accuracy, and reliability
of law enforcement data management.
Key Features:
● Centralized Relational Database – Stores complete details of FIRs, victims, suspects,
witnesses, evidence, and case statuses.
● Replacement of Paper-Based Records – Eliminates inefficiencies, delays, and risks of
loss/damage in manual record-keeping.
● Transaction Management with ACID Compliance – Ensures atomicity, consistency,
isolation, and durability for all insert, update, and delete operations.
● Query Optimization and Indexing – Improves the speed and efficiency of data
retrieval.
● Scalability – Designed to handle growing volumes of criminal records without
performance degradation.
● Security Measures – Protects confidential law enforcement data from unauthorized
access.
● Real-World Applicability – Practical for integration into law enforcement agencies and
judicial workflows.
